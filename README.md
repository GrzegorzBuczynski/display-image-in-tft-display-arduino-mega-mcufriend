# display-image-in-tft-display-arduino-mega-mcufriend
this program for displaying pictures in TFT lcd display is presented. Arduino mega is used for this purpose. TFT shield is easy to use with arduino uno but we can also use it with arduino mega with very small changes. MCUFRIEND library is used for the tft lcd display control purpose. This is one of the easiest tft lcd library to work with. The process for display picture in TFT display using arduino mega is as follows:
1. Resize the image and convert it to BMP format
2. Upload the image to the sd card
3. Insert the sd card to the 2.4 inch TFT lcd display shield 
4. Install the necessary libraries and make the instructed changes
5. Upload the given code to the arduino mega 
It's done....enjoy!
